# Load Flow Algorithm for a Radial Energy Distribution System

This repository has the implementation of a load flow for a radial power distribution system. The algorithm applies the backward/forward sweep method.


But, first of all, what is a load flow analysis? According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power-flow_study):
>In power engineering, the power-flow study, or load-flow study, is a numerical analysis of the flow of electric power in an interconnected system. Power-flow or load-flow studies are important for planning future expansion of power systems as well as in determining the best operation of existing systems. The principal information obtained from the power-flow study is the magnitude and phase angle of the voltage at each bus, and the real and reactive power flowing in each line. 

Load flow is a method used by Electrical Engineers to find the state, the electrical conditions, of an electrical grid when specific loads are connected to the system, and, hereby, discover if the grid is capable or not of supply the connected load.
