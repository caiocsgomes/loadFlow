# Load Flow Algorithm for a Radial Energy Distribution System

This repository has the implementation of a load flow for a radial power distribution system. The algorithm applies the backward/forward sweep method.

Load flow is a method used by Electrical Engineers to find the state, the electrical conditions, of an electrical grid when specific loads are connected to the system, and, hereby, discover if the grid is capable or not of supply the connected load.
